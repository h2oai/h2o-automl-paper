# H2O AutoML Paper

ðŸ‘‹ This repository contains the code for the H2O AutoML paper (link to the pdf will be added here after the paper is published).


## Experiments

- **Hardware & Software:** The "Baseline" and "Blending vs CV Stacking" experiments can be replicated using [H2O 3.30.0.3](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zahradnik/3/index.html) R package on a *c5.metal* Amazon EC2 instance (96 vCPUs, 192G RAM). An AMI called "h2oautoml_gpu" is available in us-east-1 for convenience. The experiments require R and a few other R package dependencies which can be installed using  `./utils/install.sh`.  
- **Data:** To run the experiments, first navigate to the `./data/airlines` subfolder and download the Airlines data files by running `get-data.sh`.  
- **Experiments:** Navigate to the experiment code subfolder (e.g. `blending_stacking/code`) and then run the `run-airlines-binary.sh` scripts to launch the experiments.

### Baseline

*Baseline H2O AutoML (default settings).* 


Using various subsets of the Airlines Dataset (~150M rows):

- 10k, 100k, 1M, 10M, 100M training sets
- 100k test set 


### Blending vs CV Stacking

*Compare the baseline (5-fold CV) Stacked Ensemble with 10% blending frame Stacked Ensemble.*

Using various subsets of the Airlines Dataset (~150M rows):

- 10k, 100k, 1M, 10M, 100M training sets
- 100k test set
